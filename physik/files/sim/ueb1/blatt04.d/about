blatt04.pdf
my solution sheet -- self explaining...
This is the most important file here...

code.zip
the programs mentioned in `blatt04.pdf' -- C++ programs

script.zip
scripts I used to make films or several images (aquire the data for the images
that is) -- contains it's own `about' file; look there...

2dwave_droplet.mp4
2dwave_droplet2.mp4
I expanded `wave.cpp' (found in `code.zip') to a two dimensional version --
this is an example: It's a gaussian bell on a flat surface. Think of it as a
droplet of water falling into a basin.
The code used is in
wave2d.cpp

other *.mp4
several movies I made to illustrate different algorithms etc see `blatt04.pdf'
for further details
