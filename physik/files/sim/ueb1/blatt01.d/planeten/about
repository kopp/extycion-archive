kepler.cpp     contains the main() function.
               it uses the classes planet.h and vec3d.h
planet.h       rather stupid class for planets
vec3d.h        vector class providing the most important operations

TO USE plot_energie.plt AND plot_traj.plt YOU NEED TO STORE THE FILE-OUTPUT IN
A FILE CALLED `traj'
THUS SIMPLY USE
$ g++ -O2 kepler.cpp
to compile and
$ ./a.out > traj
